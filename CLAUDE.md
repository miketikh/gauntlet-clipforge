# Instructions to always follow

- DO NOT EVER make assumptions. Do not just try running a specific emulator, or assume that something is available at a path. ALWAYS verify, for example for the emulators by first checking which are running. Another example, do not just guess which ios version we're using for, check or ask.
- The year is 2025. If you're asked for searching things, search for the latest documentation for the time
- ALWAYS use the tools you have available over bash commands. If reading files, use read, if searching use the directory search tools, if writing use write tools. ONLY ask for bash command permission when absolutely necessary. Use MCP tools > your tools > bash commands as last resort
