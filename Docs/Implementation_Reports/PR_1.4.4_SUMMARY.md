# PR 1.4.4: Split Clip at Playhead & Delete Clip - COMPLETE

## Summary

Implemented clip selection, deletion, and splitting functionality for the timeline editor. Users can now:
- Click to select clips (visual feedback with orange border)
- Delete clips using keyboard (Delete/Backspace) or right-click context menu
- Split clips at playhead position using Cmd+K/Ctrl+K or right-click context menu
- See real-time keyboard shortcut hints in the timeline header

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Store Updates (`src/renderer/store/projectStore.ts`)
- Added `selectedClipId: string | null` state to track currently selected clip
- Added `setSelectedClipId(clipId)` action to update selection
- Selection state persists in localStorage with project data

### 2. EditAPI Updates (`src/renderer/api/EditAPI.ts`)
- Updated `deleteClip()` to clear selection when deleting the selected clip
- Both `deleteClip()` and `splitClip()` methods were already fully implemented

### 3. Timeline Clip View (`src/renderer/components/TimelineClipView.tsx`)
- **Click Selection**: Click on clip to select it, displays orange border and "Selected" badge
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected clips have 3px orange border with glowing shadow effect
- **Context Menu**: Right-click shows custom context menu with:
  - "Delete Clip" option (always available)
  - "Split at Playhead" option (only when playhead is over the clip)
- **Hover Effects**: Non-selected clips lift slightly on hover
- **Selection Indicator**: Small "SELECTED" badge appears on bottom-right of selected clips

### 4. Timeline Container (`src/renderer/components/Timeline.tsx`)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Delete` or `Backspace`: Delete selected clip
  - `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux): Split selected clip at playhead position
- **Visual Hints**: Dynamic keyboard shortcut hints in timeline header:
  - Shows "Click a clip to select it" when no selection
  - Shows "Delete to delete | Cmd+K to split" when clip is selected
- **Focus Management**: Click on timeline background deselects clips
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly alerts for invalid operations

## Implementation Details

### Selection System
- Only one clip can be selected at a time
- Click on timeline background to deselect
- Selection persists across zoom/scroll operations
- Selected clips show prominent orange border (#f39c12)

### Context Menu
- Custom-built DOM-based context menu for demo simplicity
- Menu positioned at mouse cursor location
- Auto-closes when clicking anywhere
- Hover effects on menu items (red for delete, blue for split)

### Keyboard Handling
- Global keyboard listener on window
- Only processes shortcuts when a clip is selected
- Prevents default browser behavior for used shortcuts
- Validates playhead position before splitting

### Split Functionality
- Validates playhead is within clip boundaries
- Calculates relative split time within clip
- Creates two clips with correct trim points
- Original clip becomes left portion, new clip is right portion
- No gap between split clips (seamless)

### Delete Functionality
- Removes clip from timeline immediately
- Clears selection if deleting selected clip
- Updates project duration automatically
- Can delete any clip regardless of playhead position

## How to Test

### Delete Functionality
1. **Import a video**: Use the Import button or drag-drop a video file
2. **Drag to timeline**: Drag the imported media onto Track 1
3. **Select clip**: Click on the clip - verify orange border appears
4. **Keyboard delete**: Press Delete or Backspace - verify clip disappears
5. **Context menu delete**:
   - Add another clip to timeline
   - Right-click on clip
   - Select "Delete Clip" from context menu
   - Verify clip is removed

### Split Functionality
1. **Add clip to timeline**: Import and drag a video to timeline
2. **Position playhead**: Click on timeline ruler to move playhead to middle of clip
3. **Keyboard split**:
   - Click clip to select it
   - Press Cmd+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (Windows/Linux)
   - Verify clip splits into two clips at playhead position
4. **Context menu split**:
   - Add another clip
   - Move playhead over the clip
   - Right-click on clip
   - Select "Split at Playhead"
   - Verify split occurs

### Selection Verification
1. **Visual feedback**: Click clip - verify orange border and "Selected" badge
2. **Deselection**: Click timeline background - verify border disappears
3. **Multiple clips**: Add 3 clips, click each one - verify only one selected at a time
4. **Keyboard hints**: Watch timeline header hints update based on selection state

### Edge Cases
1. **Split without playhead**: Select clip, move playhead away, press Cmd+K - verify alert message
2. **Delete non-existent**: Try to delete clip that doesn't exist - verify error handling
3. **Context menu position**: Right-click near screen edges - verify menu stays visible
4. **Rapid operations**: Select, delete, select another, split - verify state stays consistent

## Known Limitations

1. **No Undo**: Deletion and splitting are permanent (undo/redo out of scope for MVP)
2. **Single Selection**: Cannot select multiple clips at once
3. **No Shift Left**: Deleted clips leave gaps (no auto-gap-closing)
4. **Simple Context Menu**: Basic DOM-based menu (not a full React component)
5. **Split Creates New ID**: Right portion of split gets new ID (expected behavior)

## Files Modified

- `src/renderer/store/projectStore.ts` - Added selectedClipId state
- `src/renderer/api/EditAPI.ts` - Updated deleteClip to clear selection
- `src/renderer/components/TimelineClipView.tsx` - Added selection, context menu, keyboard handling
- `src/renderer/components/Timeline.tsx` - Added keyboard event listeners and shortcuts
- `Tasks/phase_1_core_editor.md` - Marked PR 1.4.4 as complete

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Click clip to select (border appears)
- [x] Press Delete key (clip removed)
- [x] Right-click clip, select Delete (clip removed)
- [x] Verify projectStore updates correctly
- [x] Multiple clips work (can select and delete different ones)
- [x] Split at playhead works via keyboard
- [x] Split at playhead works via context menu
- [x] Context menu only shows split when playhead is over clip
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts display in timeline header
- [x] Selection deselects when clicking timeline background

## Next Steps

The delete and split functionality is now fully working. Next PR would be:
- **PR 1.4.5**: Playhead Scrubbing & Click-to-Seek (make playhead interactive)

## Demo Notes

Since this is a 72-hour demo project:
- Context menu is simple but functional
- No fancy animations on split (acceptable for MVP)
- Error handling uses basic alerts (sufficient for demo)
- Focus is on working features over polish
