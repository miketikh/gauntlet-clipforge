# PR 1.4.5 Complete: Playhead Scrubbing & Click-to-Seek

## Changes Made

Implemented interactive playhead functionality that allows users to scrub through the timeline by dragging the playhead handle or clicking anywhere on the timeline to jump to specific positions.

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Draggable Playhead Handle**
   - The triangular handle at the top of the playhead is now draggable
   - Smooth dragging updates playhead position in real-time
   - Visual feedback: handle changes to lighter red (#ff6b6b) while dragging
   - Tooltip displays current time (MM:SS or HH:MM:SS format) during drag
   - No transition animation while dragging for smooth responsiveness

2. **Click-to-Seek on Timeline Ruler**
   - Clicking anywhere on the time ruler jumps the playhead to that position
   - Position is calculated from mouse X coordinate and current zoom level
   - Cursor changes to pointer to indicate clickability

3. **Click-to-Seek on Track Areas**
   - Clicking on empty track space moves the playhead to that position
   - Properly ignores clicks on clips (they have their own selection handlers)
   - Works across all tracks in the timeline

4. **Position Constraints**
   - Playhead cannot move before 0 seconds
   - Playhead cannot move beyond project duration
   - All position calculations are clamped to valid range

5. **Time Formatting**
   - MM:SS format for durations under 1 hour
   - HH:MM:SS format for longer durations
   - Monospace font for consistent time display

## Files Modified

- **src/renderer/components/Playhead.tsx**
  - Added `isDragging` state
  - Added `containerRef` for position calculations
  - Implemented `handleMouseDown` for initiating drag
  - Added document-level `mousemove` and `mouseup` event listeners
  - Added `calculatePositionFromMouse` helper function
  - Added time tooltip that appears during drag
  - Added visual feedback (color change) during drag

- **src/renderer/components/TimelineRuler.tsx**
  - Added `rulerRef` for position calculations
  - Implemented `handleRulerClick` to calculate clicked position
  - Added cursor pointer and onClick handler

- **src/renderer/components/TimelineTrack.tsx**
  - Added import for `useProjectStore`
  - Implemented `handleTrackClick` to seek on track click
  - Added click detection that ignores clips (checks for `data-clip-id` attribute)
  - Added cursor pointer to track content area

- **src/renderer/components/TimelineClipView.tsx**
  - Added `data-clip-id` attribute to clip div for proper click detection

- **src/renderer/components/Timeline.tsx**
  - Updated `handleTimelineClick` to support seeking (though most clicks are now handled by TimelineTrack)

- **Tasks/phase_1_core_editor.md**
  - Marked all tasks as complete [x]
  - Updated task notes to reflect actual implementation

## How to Test

1. **Drag Playhead Handle**
   - Click and hold the red triangular handle at the top of the playhead
   - Drag left/right - verify playhead moves smoothly
   - Notice the time tooltip appears showing current position
   - Notice the handle turns lighter red while dragging
   - Release mouse - verify playhead stays at the new position

2. **Click on Time Ruler**
   - Click anywhere on the time ruler at the top of the timeline
   - Verify playhead immediately jumps to the clicked position
   - Try clicking at different positions to test accuracy

3. **Click on Track Space**
   - Click on empty track areas (not on clips)
   - Verify playhead jumps to the clicked position
   - Click on a clip - verify it selects the clip (not seeking)

4. **Test Constraints**
   - Try to drag playhead before 0 - verify it stops at 0
   - Try to drag past project end - verify it stops at project duration
   - Zoom in/out and test dragging - verify calculations work at all zoom levels

5. **Multiple Clips Test**
   - Add several clips to the timeline
   - Drag playhead across clips - verify smooth movement
   - Click between clips - verify accurate positioning
   - Click before first clip - verify playhead goes to clicked position

6. **Store Verification**
   - Open browser DevTools console
   - Watch playheadPosition update in real-time as you drag
   - Verify position is in seconds (not pixels)

## Known Limitations

- **Clip snapping (optional)**: Not implemented - playhead moves freely without snapping to clip boundaries. This was marked as optional in requirements and can be added later if needed for better UX.

- **Performance**: Updates occur on every mousemove event. If performance issues arise with very long timelines or slow machines, consider adding debouncing.

## Technical Notes

- Uses standard React drag pattern: onMouseDown on element, document-level mousemove/mouseup
- Position calculation: `(mouseX - containerLeft) / pixelsPerSecond`
- Constraints applied using `Math.max(0, Math.min(position, duration))`
- Transitions disabled during drag for smooth UX
- Click handlers use event.stopPropagation() to prevent conflicts between clips and track area

## Next Up

**PR 1.5.1: Video Player Component & Single Clip Playback**
- Implement HTML5 video player in Preview component
- Connect playhead position to video currentTime
- Add play/pause controls
- Enable real-time preview of timeline content
