# PR 1.5.1 Complete: Video Player Component & Single Clip Playback

## Changes Made:

Implemented a fully functional video player in the Preview component with synchronized playback controls. The player loads video files from the timeline using the HTML5 video element and file:// URLs (required for Electron). Key features include:

1. **playerStore.ts** - New Zustand store managing playback state (isPlaying, currentTime, volume, playbackRate) with actions for play, pause, seek, setVolume, and setPlaybackRate.

2. **Preview.tsx** - Complete rewrite with:
   - HTML5 video element that fills the preview area with aspect ratio preservation
   - Automatic video loading when playhead moves to different clips
   - Real-time playhead synchronization during playback using requestAnimationFrame
   - Play/Pause button with visual feedback
   - Volume slider (0-100%) with live display
   - Time display showing current position / total duration in MM:SS format
   - Automatic pause when video reaches end of clip

3. **Keyboard Controls** - Industry-standard video editor shortcuts:
   - Spacebar: Toggle play/pause
   - Left/Right arrows: Seek backward/forward 5 seconds
   - J/K/L: -1 second / Pause / +1 second (professional editor standard)

4. **Timeline Integration**:
   - Uses `findClipAtPosition()` to determine which clip to play at current playhead
   - Accounts for trim points when calculating video offset
   - Syncs playheadPosition with video currentTime during playback
   - Pauses automatically at clip boundaries (multi-clip seamless playback is PR 1.5.2)

## How to Test:

1. **Import and add a clip**: Import a video file via Media Library, drag it onto Track 1
2. **Click Play button**: Verify video plays in preview with audio synchronized
3. **Verify playhead moves**: Watch the timeline - the red playhead should move during playback
4. **Click Pause**: Verify playback stops
5. **Keyboard shortcuts**:
   - Press Spacebar - toggle play/pause
   - Press Left Arrow - seek backward 5 seconds
   - Press Right Arrow - seek forward 5 seconds
   - Press J - rewind 1 second
   - Press K - pause/play toggle
   - Press L - fast forward 1 second
6. **Volume control**: Adjust volume slider - verify audio volume changes
7. **Playhead scrubbing**: Drag timeline playhead to different position - verify video seeks to match
8. **Play to end**: Let video play to the end of the clip - verify it pauses automatically
9. **Time display**: Verify current time and duration display updates in real-time

## Known Limitations:

- **Single clip only**: Currently only plays one clip at a time. When playhead reaches end of clip, playback pauses. Multi-clip seamless playback will be implemented in PR 1.5.2.
- **Track 0 only**: For MVP, only plays clips on Track 0 (main track). Multi-track compositing comes later.
- **No scrub preview**: Dragging playhead doesn't show video preview until you release (could add in future).
- **Keyboard conflicts**: If user is typing in an input field, keyboard shortcuts won't interfere (checks `e.target === document.body`).

## Technical Notes:

- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps playhead updates (not setInterval)
- Converts file paths to file:// URLs for Electron security model
- Handles trim points correctly: `videoTime = trimStart + (playheadPosition - clipStartTime)`
- Volume stored as 0-1 internally, displayed as 0-100%
- Time formatting supports both MM:SS and HH:MM:SS for longer videos
- Player state persists across component remounts via Zustand store

## Next Up:

**PR 1.5.2**: Multi-Clip Timeline Playback - Implement seamless playback across multiple timeline clips with automatic clip switching and preloading for smooth transitions.
